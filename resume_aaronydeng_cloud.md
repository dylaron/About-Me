## EXPERIENCE

### Keirton Inc
Surrey, BC, Canada

2019-present, Chief Design Engineer - Cloud Computing and IoT

- Successfully architected, developed and deployed a cloud platform that enables data
communication, diagnosis and firmware updates for a range of our machinery products, using a
micro-service approach, primarily based on AWS infrastructure. Its main components include
  - An ETL Pipelines that collects data from a few different products in the field, and save into
databases (MySQL and MongoDB). Different protocols are used (OPC-UA, REST/HTTP API,
MQTT) for communication with different controller types (PLCs, Linux PC, and
microcontrollers).
  - Big data analysis on the back end. (Python, Pandas)
  - A web portal to present aggregated data to customers as dashboards. (PHP, JavaScript)
  - APIs to dispatch updates of firmware and machine learning model (Python, Node.js)

This project had became a crucial part of the company’s digital transformation roadmap. It has
provided both us and our customers plenty great insights of the operation with our products.

- Developed a ‘3D scanner’ to measure the profile of plant material loaded on a conveyor belt, and a
control algorithm on the downstream PLC controller to react to the measurement. The purpose of
such device is
  - Ensuring a constant volume flow rate from the conveyor regardless of loading consistency
  - Tracking the volume value and provided to the customer on the cloud dashboard.

Collaborating with industrial designers and contractor manufactures, we successfully delivered a
solution that significantly improves the customer’s workflow and output quality.

2017-2019, Design Engineer - Automation

- Implemented an automation control into our latest and largest industrial machine: TwisterTrimmer
T-Zero. Multiple VFD/motors, actuators and sensors are coordinated with a PLC with user input
through a touchscreen HMI device.
- eveloped an electronic product with wireless cloud connectivity. My main contributions were
circuit design and microcontroller firmware programming (C++)

### Deere-Hitachi Specialty Products
Langley, BC, Canada

2014-2017, Design Engineer

- Full lifecycle involvement in development for the new generation of Deere G-series forestry swing
machines and Hitachi dash-six Foresters. Participated through the entire process: initial design,
prototypes, to the final production and continuous improvement.

### Knight Trailer Sales Inc
Langley, BC, Canada

2011-2014, Principle Engineer

- Development of heavy duty transportation vehicles and equipments. Work scope includes
mechanical designing and drafting, BOM creating, and fabrication line support. About 60 products
have been developed or revised during my service.
- Re-built the company website. Including a web-app to generate new VIN number in compliant format when registering new trailer vehicle. (JavaScript/HTML)


### De Amertek Corporation
Oak Brook, IL, United States

2007-2010, R&D Project Engineer / Project Manager

- Actively involved in products development and testing, including electrical ballasts, sensors,
actuators, electronic controllers, brushless motors and other electro-mechanical assemblies.
- Motor design: Developed a 3-phase brushless DC motor for automotive Electric Power-Assisted
Steering (EPAS) application
