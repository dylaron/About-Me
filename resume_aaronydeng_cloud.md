## EXPERIENCE

### Keirton Inc (Twister Trimmer)
Surrey, BC, Canada
[www.keirton.com](https://www.keirton.com)

2019-present, Chief Design Engineer - Cloud Computing and IoT

- Successfully architected, developed and deployed a cloud platform that enables data communication, diagnosis and firmware updates for a range of our machinery products, using a micro-service approach, primarily based on AWS infrastructure. This project had became a crucial part of the company’s digital transformation roadmap. It has provided both us and our customers plenty great insights of the operation with our products. Its main components include
  - An ETL Pipelines that collects data from a few different products in the field, and save into
databases (MySQL and MongoDB). Different protocols are used (OPC-UA, REST/HTTP API,
MQTT) for communication with different controller types (PLCs, Linux PC, and
microcontrollers).
  - Big data analysis on the back end. (Python, Pandas)
  - A web portal to present aggregated data to customers as dashboards. (PHP, JavaScript)
  - APIs to dispatch updates of firmware and machine learning model (Python, Node.js)

- Developed a ‘3D scanner’ to measure the profile of plant material loaded on a conveyor belt, and a
control algorithm on the downstream PLC controller to react to the measurement. The purpose of
such device is 1. to ensuring a constant volume flow rate from the conveyor regardless of loading consistency. 2. and to track the volume throughput for the customer on the cloud dashboard.  
Collaborating with industrial designers and contractor manufactures, we successfully delivered a solution that significantly improves the customer’s workflow and output quality.

- Assisted on developing a new product powered by Machine Learning / Image Segmentation.

2017-2019, Design Engineer - Automation

- Implemented an automation control into our latest and largest industrial machine: TwisterTrimmer
T-Zero. Multiple VFD/motors, actuators and sensors are coordinated with a PLC with user input through a touchscreen HMI device.

- eveloped an electronic product with wireless cloud connectivity. My main contributions were circuit design and microcontroller firmware programming (C++)
