## EXPERIENCE

### Keirton Inc (Twister Trimmer)
Surrey, BC, Canada
[www.keirton.com](https://www.keirton.com)

2019-present, Chief Design Engineer - Cloud Computing and IoT

- Successfully developed a unified cloud platform that digitally integrates a range of machinery products. For over 3 years since initial deployment, it has been providing valuable insights of how the TwisterTrimmer products were operating. This project had made it possible to introduce a new rental option into the business model. The customer do not have to make a large financial commitment upfront to purchase the equipment, instead they could be only paying for the hours of usage every month. That helped TwisterTrimmer reach into a larger customer base, and bring in a new consistent revenue stream. A micro-service approach is used in the architecture and the main components include
  - An ETL Pipelines that collects data from a few different products in the field, and save into
databases (MySQL and MongoDB). Different protocols are used (OPC-UA, REST/HTTP API,
MQTT) for communication with different controller types (PLCs, Linux PC, and
microcontrollers).
  - Big data analysis on the back end. (Python, Pandas)
  - A web portal to present aggregated data to customers as dashboards. (PHP, JavaScript)
  - APIs to dispatch updates of firmware and machine learning model (Python, Node.js)

- Developed a ‘3D scanner’ using machine vision (OpenCV) techniques. It measures the profile of plant material loaded on a conveyor belt, and a PLC controller will adjust the conveyor speed accordingly based on an algorithm. This device ensures a consistent feed from the conveyor and therefore improves processing quality. Also, the device brings more telemetry data into the dashboard for the customer.

- Assisted on developing a new product powered by Machine Learning / Image Segmentation.

2017-2019, Design Engineer - Automation

- Implemented an automation control into our latest and largest industrial machine (TwisterTrimmer T-Zero). A touchscreen HMI and a PLC controller system is built to orchestrate the operating of multiple VFD/motors, actuators and sensors. My responsibilities included mechanical design, electrical design, and PLC/HMI programming.

- Developed an electronic product with wireless cloud connectivity. My main contributions were circuit design and microcontroller firmware programming (C++)
